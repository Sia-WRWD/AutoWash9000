<p>
  This is an Automated Car Wash Control which I have named it as the AutoWash9000 which is done for my System Programming & Computer Control (SPCC) Module.
  
  The system contains two main UIs which the mobile one is for the client and the tablet one is for the staffs/admins. 
</p>
  
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  As the world transitions into a digital and technological era, more processes are being automated by machines. It is no stranger to many of the concept of 
  automating the car washing process by using a machine. Thus, in this assignment, the design and implementation of the controls for the AutoWash9000 would be 
  explored, documented and critically discussed. The documentation would cover 6 main important sections which are “Assumptions” (which talks about some of the 
  assumptions made about the car wash system in terms of what happens during, after or before the process), “System Design” (which contains the graphical
  representation of the AutoWash9000in the form of Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagrams and etc), “Protocol Design” (which contains the description and showing of 
  the design of the AutoWash9000’s logics), “Health and Safety Considerations” (that contains about some of the measures that are in order and could be taken in the 
  event of an emergency), “Implementation” (which talks about the hardware requirements of the AutoWash9000) and Conclusion (which covers about what I have learnt 
  so far during the planning, design and implementation of the AutoWash9000, future enhancements and limitations of the AutoWash9000). 
</p>
  
<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
  In conclusion, the AutoWash9000 has been a success as the initial objectives and conditions of building the control have been met. Moving on, I would like to talk about some
  of the limitations of the control which I noticed (as shown in Table 2 below) and some of the future enhancement that could be implemented to better the control.
  
  <h4>Limitations:</h4>
  - Only Able to Monitor Car per Wash Cycle.
  - Insufficient Safety Measures.
  - Lack of Interactive Functions.
  
  <h4>Future Enhancements:</h4>
  - Addition of More Types of Wash.
  - Less Resources Required to Run the Program.
  - Faster Speed and Response Time.
  - Logging of Extra Data.

<h2>Please Pay Attention:</h2>
<p>
  Login Credentials are Available at:
  Resources --> User.txt

  In the event if a data is not logged after the wash, 
  please check if and ensure that the server.vi is running 
  or the data will not be logged.

  Or if the data did not appear after the wash or registering 
  a new admin when you are logged in as admin. Please click 
  on the 'refresh' buttons.


  Thank You.
